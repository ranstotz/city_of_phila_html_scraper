2.) Change the directory to be in the "source" directory.
3.) Enter "make" into the command line to build the Docker
    image (be sure to be in "source" directory).
4.) "make" also places you inside the Docker container with
    all necessary dependencies.

6.) This runs the script and pulls the Account Number from
    the config file (http_data.conf) in the same directory
    as source in the container.
7.) Unique files are written to the "out" directory.
8.) See comments in source files for more details.
9.) Dockerfile is located in "docker_build" directory.
10.) If you would like to change the account number, please modify it in the
    http_data.conf file in the "source" directory.
11.) All output is saved in the /source/out directory in ".json" files.
